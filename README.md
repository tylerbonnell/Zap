# Zap
File Decompression/Protection Program

Have you ever thought to yourself "these files are too small!"? 
Have you ever lost a file in the abyss of bits that is your massive modern hard drive?
Are you afraid of small numbers?
Then **Zap** is for you!

## Pad Your Data
Zap protects your important files from improper handling by cushioning them with protective bitsâ„¢. 

## Keep It Secure
Standard file extensions like .txt and .pdf are easy to open and are susceptible to prying eyes. Keep your data secure by using our state-of-the-art .zap file.

## Don't Lose It!
In these days of rapidly progressing technology, storage is bountiful, but security is not. It's easy for a little file to fall through the cracks and be lost forever in the digital ether. Make sure it doesn't happen by Zapping your files and guaranteeing you'll never lose them again!
