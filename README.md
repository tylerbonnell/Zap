# Zap
File Decompression/Protection Program

Have you ever thought to yourself "these files are too small!"? 
Have you ever lost a file in the abyss of bits that is your massive modern hard drive?
Are you afraid of small numbers?
Then **Zap** is for you!

## Pad Your Data
Zap protects your important files from improper handling by cushioning them with protective bitsâ„¢. 

## Keep It Secure
Standard file extensions like .txt and .pdf are easy to open and are susceptible to prying eyes. Keep your data secure by using our state-of-the-art .zap file.

## Don't Lose It!
In these days of rapidly progressing technology, storage is bountiful, but security is not. It's easy for a little file to fall through the cracks and be lost forever in the digital ether. Make sure it doesn't happen by Zapping your files and guaranteeing you'll never lose them again!

# Usage
Compile Zap.java, put it in the folder of the file you want to Zap. You can use it two ways:

1. Run "java Zap" via the terminal, and enter in the arguments as prompted.

2. Use command line arguments. You can enter "java Zap filename.txt 5" to create filename.zap, a file that will contain all of filename.txt's information, and it will be 5 times the size. You can enter "java Zap -u filename.zap" to unzap filename.zap and get a working file again. Note that this will overwrite filename.txt if it exists in the folder already.

<sub>Notice: This program is a joke. Zap is not guaranteed to protect your data from anything. Be careful.</sub>
